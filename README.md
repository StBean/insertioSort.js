/*
On a high level view of the insetion sort process, involves assigning the first element in an array to the mininum value. After doing so the min variable will be compared to each element in the by looping through the values from array index 0 to array index of array.length - 1 and using an if/else condition if a successive array value is less than the initial min variable value. If the condition is met a the min variable will be assigned to that array element with the lower value. After one sweep through the array the min variable value is determined and moved to the front of the array or array index 0. The process will repeat again this time starting at the second array index and so forth until the all of the min variable are swapped to their location within the array based on a for loop's starting index element which is always reset to the variable min. then array The result will be a sorted array from the front of the array to the end, with the lowest value being the in the first array index position.  We access the value of the variable min by reffering to it as array[min]. For example, if array element at array index position 3 was 5 and was assigned to the variable min, then array[min] = 5.
